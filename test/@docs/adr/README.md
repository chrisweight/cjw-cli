# Architecture Decision Records

ADRs document deviations from [CAT Team Standards](https://teamdocs.digitalpfizer.com). ADRs also document project-specific decisions that do not impact the CAT Team as a whole. All projects inherit from CAT Team Standards unless an ADR documents the deviation. Read more about ADRs [here](https://teamdocs.digitalpfizer.com/adr).
